	<h2>Module Experience:</h2> <br>
	 <p>I began my studies at NAMI with no prior knowledge of computer science. I was a slacker at the start of the semester, unable to pay attention in class. This was interfering with my studies, but I was the one to ignore it. I am aware that I am not very good at coding and computer science. This is the path I chose for my bright future. I led myself down the wrong path. I am pleased with the course and structure, but my carelessness caused me to fail. I was unable to perform well, which lowered my self-esteem to an all-time low. My colleague was the one who inspired me to study and complete my assignment.Our module leader is an incredible person who was always focused on me in class. He concentrated on me and assisted me, which encouraged me. NAMI College provided an incredible learning experience. NAMI's environment is clean, green, and peaceful. Our other faculties are also extremely beneficial. </p>
